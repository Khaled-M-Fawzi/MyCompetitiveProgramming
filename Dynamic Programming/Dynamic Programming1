Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion . Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for 
same inputs , we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming . The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not
have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.
For example, if we write simple recursive solution for Fibonacci Numbers, we get exponential time complexity and if we optimize it 
by storing solutions of subproblems, time complexity reduces to polynomial (linear)

  Recursion : Exponentail

int fib(int n)
{
    if(n<2)return n;
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}


  Dynamic Programming : Polynomial

vector<int>dp(1e7);
int fib(int n)
{
    if(n<2)return n;
    if(dp[n])return dp[n];
    return dp[n] = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}

**************  Tabulation vs Memoization   ***************
There are following two different ways to store the values so that the values of a sub-problem can be reused
Here, will discuss two patterns of solving DP problem:

Tabulation   : Bottom Up
Memoization  : Top Down


                      Tabulation Method – Bottom Up Dynamic Programming 
                      
As the name itself suggests starting from the bottom and cumulating answers to the top
Let’s describe a state for our DP problem to be dp[x] with dp[0] as base state and dp[n] as our destination state. 
So, we need to find the value of destination state i.e dp[n].
If we start our transition from our base state i.e dp[0] and follow our state transition relation to reach our destination state dp[n]
we call it Bottom Up approach as it is quite clear that we started our transition from the bottom base state and reached the top most 
desired state

Now, Why do we call it tabulation method?
To know this let’s first write some code to calculate the factorial of a number using bottom up approach
Once, again as our general procedure to solve a DP we first define a state. 
In this case, we define a state as dp[x], where dp[x] is to find the factorial of x
Now, it is quite obvious that dp[x+1] = dp[x] * (x+1)

// Tabulated version to find factorial x.
int dp[MAXN];

// base case
int dp[0] = 1;
for (int i = 1; i< =n; i++)
{
    dp[i] = dp[i-1] * i;
}



                     Memoization Method – Top Down Dynamic Programming 
Here, we start our journey from the top most destination state and compute its answer by taking in count the values of states that can
reach the destination state, till we reach the bottom most base state.

Once again, let’s write the code for the factorial problem in the top-down fashion

// Memoized version to find factorial x.
// To speed up we store the values
// of calculated states

int dp[MAXN];
int solve(int x)
{
    if (x==0)
        return 1;
    if (dp[x])
        return dp[x];
    return dp[x] = x * solve(x-1);
}
