Iterators 
An iterator is an object (like a pointer) that points to an element inside the container. We can use iterators to move through
the contents of the container
Every Container has a iterator and a const_iterator
set<int>::iterator it;           // access to Container elements OR modify OR assign 
set<int>::const_iterator it;     //access to Container elements (Read_only)

Types of iterators: Based upon the functionality of the iterators, they can be classified into five major categories:

#Input Iterators#    ===>>>   They are the weakest of all the iterators and have very limited functionality. They can only be used in 
a single-pass algorithms, i.e.,those algorithms which process the container sequentially such that no element is accessed more than once
int x=*it;

#Output Iterators#   ===>>>   Just like input iterators, they are also very limited in their functionality and can only be used in 
a single-pass algorithm, but not for accessing elements, but for being assigned elements
*it=100;

#Forward Iterator#   ===>>> They are higher in hierarachy than input and output iterators, and contain all the features present in these
two iterators. But, as the name suggests, they also can only move in forward direction and that too one step at a time

#Bidirectional Iterators#   ===>>>  They have all the features of forward iterators along with the fact that they overcome 
the drawback of forward iterators, as they can move in both the directions, that is why their name is bidirectional

#Random-Access Iterators#   ===>>>  They are the most powerful iterators. They are not limited to moving sequentially, as their name 
suggests,they can randomly access any element inside the container. They are the ones whose functionality is same as pointers

// Iterator Fuction
advance(itr,5);  // move itr forward 5 steps . equal itr+=5
Complixty : Constant for random-access iterators. Otherwise, linear in n
