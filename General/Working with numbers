The most used integer type in competitive programming is int, which is a 32-bit type with a value range of −2 * 10^31 . . . (2 * 10^31)−1 
OR about −2 * 109 . . . 2 * 109
If the type int is not enough, the 64-bit type long long can be used. It has a value range of −2 * 10^63 . . . (2 * 10^63)-1
OR about −9 * 10^18 . . . 9 * 10^18

cout<< 8380238475ll ;
The suffix ll means that the type of the number is long long

int (op) int = int 
int (op) long long = long long

op could be + (addition) , - (subtraction) , * (multiplication) , / (division)


A common mistake when using the type long long is that the type int is still used somewhere in the code
For example, the following code contains a subtle-error

int a = 123456789;
long long b = a*a;
cout << b << "\n"; // -1757895751

Even though the variable b is of type long long, both numbers in the expression a*a are of type int and the result is also of type int Because of this, the
variable b will contain a wrong result
The problem can be solved by changing the type of a to long long or by changing the expression to (long long)a*a
