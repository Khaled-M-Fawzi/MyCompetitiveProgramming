Given a string what is the longest prefix that is palindrome ?
Ex. effedcba ==>> effe 
let's assume the char # will not be part of problem 
input + '#' + reverse_input
effedcba#abcdeffe
Now problem , find longest prefix that is suffix .
Failure functiong can answer that easily : F[size-1] is answer
Time Complexity O(n)

************* 2  **************

OR reverse the problem
Given a string what is the longest suffix that is palindrome ?
Ex. abcdeffe ==>> effe 
we reverse that string
Now problem , find the longest prefix that is palindrome .
Time Complexity O(n)

************* 3  **************

Given a string , what is minimum characters to add to convert string to palindrome ?
aaaa ==>> aaaa
abc  ==>> abcba
abcdeffe  ==>> abdcdeffedcba

let's k = longest suffix that is palidrome
answer = length of string - k ;
Time Complexity O(n)
