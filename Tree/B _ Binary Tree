Binary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children 
which are referred to as the left child and the right child
in programming
struct node
{
     Type item;
     node* left;
     node* right;
};

Full(strictly) Binary Tree
if every node has zero or two children

           O
         /   \
        O     O
      /   \
     O     O
         /   \
        O     O
        
Complete Binary Tree
1) all levels is completely filled except the last level
2) all Nodes as left as possible in the last level

           O
         /   \
        O     O
      /   \
     O     O
   
   
This below binary trees is not complete binary tree

           O     O
           
Perfect Binary tree
1) every node has two children except leaves
2) all leaves are at the same level
            O            
         /     \
        O       O
