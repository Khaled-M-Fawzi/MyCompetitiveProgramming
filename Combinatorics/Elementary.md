# Elementary

Any Task 

### with repetition

n^r

Ex. you have 5 pens and you want to write 3 tasks so number of ways is 5^3 

Ex. you forgot your password but you know it consists of 3 letters of this set A={a,b,e,i,p} so number of ways is 5^3

### without repetition

**order is important** (Permutation)

**Permutation** : It is the different arrangements of a given number of elements taken one by one, or some, or all at a time

For example, if we have two elements A and B, then there are two possible arrangements, AB and BA

`nPr = P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!`
                 
Ex. you forgot your password but you know it consists of 3 distinct letters of this set A={a,b,e,i,p} so number of ways is 5P3 = 5! / (5-3)!

**order is not important** (Combination)

**Combination** : It is the different selections of a given number of elements taken one by one, or some, or all at a time

For example, if we have two elements A and B, then there is only one way select two items, we select both of them

`nCr = C(n,r) = n! / (n-r)! * r!`

Ex. Picking a team of 3 people from a group of 10 = 10C3 = 10! / (10-3)! * 3!
 
 `nCr = nC(n â€“ r)`

NOTE : In the same example, we have different cases for permutation and combination

For permutation, AB and BA are two different things but for selection, AB and BA are same
