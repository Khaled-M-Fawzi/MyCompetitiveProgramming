Any Task 
1) with repetition 
                 n^r
                 Ex. you have 5 pens and you want to write 3 tasks so number of ways is 5^3 
                 Ex. you forgot your password but you know it consists of 3 letters of this set A={a,b,e,i,p} so number of ways is 5^3
2) without repetition
        1/ order is important (Permutation)
                 nPr = P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!
                 Ex. you forgot your password but you know it consists of 3 distinct letters of this set A={a,b,e,i,p} so number of ways 
                 is 5P3 = 5! / (5-3)!
        2/ order is not important (Combination)
                  nCr = C(n,r) = n! / (n-r)! * r!
                  Ex. Picking a team of 3 people from a group of 10 = 10C3 = 10! / (10-3)! * 3!
                  nCr = nC(n â€“ r)
