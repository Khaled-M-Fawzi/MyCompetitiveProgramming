#  Pigeonhole Principle

Assume we have N=5 boxes and M=6 apples​

Distribute apples in boxes in whatever way​

There must be 1 box with at least 2 apples​

If you want to avoid duplicate:​

Put 1 apple per box. Remaining is 1 apple.​

To put it, one box will have 2 apples​

What if we have 13 apples?​

1 box will have at least	⌈13/5⌉ = 3 apples​

Generally: ⌈N/M⌉ per a box.
