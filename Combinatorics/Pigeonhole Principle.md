#  Pigeonhole Principle

Assume we have N=5 boxes and M=6 apples, Distribute apples in boxes in whatever way, There must be 1 box with at least 2 apples.

If you want to avoid duplicate: Put 1 apple per box. Remaining is 1 apple. To put it, one box will have 2 apples.

**What if we have 13 apples?**

1 box will have at least	⌈13/5⌉ = 3 apples. Generally: ⌈N/M⌉ per a box.

Prove: Among any N positive integers, there	exists 2 whose difference is divisible  by N-1.

Recall: |A-B| % X = 0 IFF A%X = B%X. So, **let’s compute % N-1?**

Then we have N-1 values, each in range [0 - N-2]. But, we have N numbers, then at least one mode will be duplicate

Given that 2 numbers at least has same % N-1. Then, their difference must be divisible by N-1. Always relate % with Pigeonhole

Case for previous problem: Let A represents array of numbers.

N = 5 and	A = {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}

Compute A % 4 = {2, 3, 1, 3, 0}, 5 numbers, with values [0 - 3].

Pick 2 with same mode -> 3 is repeated mode. Then, (3, 7) are the answer

Prove: For any N positive integers, find **the sum of subset of them is divisible N**.

Compute Accum array % N. Accum[i] = {A[0] + A[1]...A[i]} % N

If any Accum[i] = 0, we are done. Otherwise, we have N values in [1 - N-1].

Then 2 positions will have same mode. Then getting numbers between them is answer.

Let A represents array of numbers

N = 5 and	A = {2, 4, 8, 2, 7}, Accumulate:	B =	{2, 6, 14, 16, 23}

Mode 5:	C =	{2, 1, 4, 1, 3}

Any zeros? No..remaining 4 values spread on  5 values...one of them must be repeated.

if yes then A[0]+A[1]...A[i] where C[i] % N = 0. 2nd and 4th have mode 1. Then range from 3rd till 4th is answer: 8, 2

In some problems, it can be the major trick. Sometimes comes with Modular Arithmetic.

**Some facts in graph**

1) A Path of M nodes (M > N) must have a node used more than once.

2) A cycle of Length M (M > N nodes), must be composed of cycles each of Length <= N.

3) Every graph contains two vertices of same degree.


### Powers tower % M

Let’s compute: 2^3^4^5^6^7^8 % 56.

We can solve it using Euler theorem. let’s simplify it, compute 2^X % 56. where x is very large, e.g. x = 3^4^5^6^7^8.

Imagine we compute 2^i%M for i [0 - OO]. We know we have M mod values: [0 - M-1].

Pigeonhole: values repeat in maximum M + 1 iterations. Then computing X should have same value as one of the first powers in range [0-M-1]. But which 2^i%M correspond to 2^x%M ?

Let’s simulate it.
```
   i         0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7
2^i % 56     1    2    4    8    16   32   8    16
```
2^6 is same as 2^3. Then 2^7 must = 2^4...etc. {8,16,32} is cycle and {1,2,4} is precycle.

Let length of the cycle be L, and length of precycle be P.

Given some X, we can compute its i position. i = P + ( L + X % L - P % L ) % L -->> (X-P)%L + P

Then? Solve subproblem X % L in same manner. Then compute 2^i % M.
