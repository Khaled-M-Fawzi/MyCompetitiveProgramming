```cpp
/*
Directed graph : is a graph in which all the edges are uni-directional
Undirected graph: is a graph in which all the edges are bi-directional 
Weighted graph: In which each edge is assigned a weight or cost
Cyclic graph: if the graph comprises a path that starts from a vertex and ends at the same vertex
Connected graph: if from any node in graph , we can reach to all nodes
Disconnected graph: if above condition is not met
Null Graph: A graph having no edges
Trivial Graph: a graph with only one vertex
Simple graph: if graph doesn't contain any loop or parallel edges
Not simple graph: if above condition is not met
K-regular Graph: if all its vertices have the same degree k.
Complete graph: if from any node in graph , we can reach to all nodes but path = 1
Bipartite Graph: vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, every edge connects a vertex in V1 to one in V2.  
Complete Bipartite Graph: if every vertex in V1 is connected to every vertex of V2.
Star Graph: a grapth that n â€“ 1 vertices are connected to a single central vertex
