Directed graph : is a graph in which all the edges are uni-directional
Undirected graph: is a graph in which all the edges are bi-directional 
Weighted graph: In which each edge is assigned a weight or cost
Cyclic graph: if the graph comprises a path that starts from a vertex and ends at the same vertex
Connected graph: if from any node in graph , we can reach to all nodes
Disconnected graph: if above condition is not met
Null Graph: A graph having no edges
Trivial Graph: a graph with only one vertex
Simple graph: if graph doesn't contain any loop or parallel edges
Not simple graph: if above condition is not met
K-regular Graph: if all its vertices have the same degree k.
Complete graph: if from any node in graph , we can reach to all nodes but path = 1
Bipartite Graph: vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, every edge connects a vertex in V1 to one in V2.  
Complete Bipartite Graph: if every vertex in V1 is connected to every vertex of V2.
Star Graph: a grapth that n â€“ 1 vertices are connected to a single central vertex
Complement of a Graph: if both graph I and graph II are combined together to form a complete graph,
then graph I and graph II are called complements of each other
Simple path: is a path from v to w with no repeated vertices, except that the first and last may be the same vertex.
Tree is a connected graph that doesn't contain any cycles in which any two vertices are connected by only one path.
Tree is an acyclic graph and has N - 1 edges where N is the number of vertices. Each node in a graph may have one 
or multiple parent nodes. However, in a tree, each node (except the root node) comprises exactly one parent node.

Depth(C) = 2 (path from root to C) , Depth(E) = 1 , Depth(A) = 0
Height(B) = 1 (path from B to the farthest leave node) , Height(A) = 2
Height of tree is path from root to the farthest leave node
Height of tree that has only one node is zero
Height of empty tree is -1
`Edges = number of nodes - 1` 
outdegree(A) = 3 (number of nodes branched from A) 
indegree(F) = 1 (number of nodes that F is branched from) 
degree(B) = outdegree(B) + indegree(B) = 2 + 1 = 3
