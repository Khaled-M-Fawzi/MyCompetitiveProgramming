Tree is special form of graph , Tree is an undirected graph

  O ==>> vertices , nodes , points
  
____ ==>> edges , arcs , lines

Types of graph
1) Directed graph       A ---> B       E = { (A,B) }
2) Undirected graph     A ---- B       E = { (A,B) , (B,A) }

                           4 
1) Directed Weighted    A ---> B

                           2
2) Undirected Weighted  A ---- B  


1) Connected Graph ( if from any node in graph , we can reach to all nodes)

     A ←-- D
     ↓     ↑
     B --→ C
     
2) Disconnected Graph ( if above condition is not met )

     A --→ D
     ↓     ↑
     B --→ C
     ↓
     E
     
     Adjacent vertices(A) = {B,D} 
     Adjacent vertices(C) = {D}
     Adjacent edges(A,B)  = { (A,D) , (B,C) , (B,E) }
     

         Loop                  A
  B ←-- A --→                 ↑↓ Parallel edges
        ↑ ← ↓                  B
Adjacent vertices(A) = {B,A}

if graph doesn't contain any loop or parallel graph it's called Simple graph otherwise it's called not simple graph


A cyclic graph is a graph containing at least one graph cycle. A graph that is not cyclic is said to be acyclic
Cyclic graphs are not trees
     A ←-- D
     ↓     ↑
     B --→ C
     ↓
     E ←-- F

Loop at any node not present graph cycle
A cycle in a directed graph is a path of at least 2 length such that the first vertax on the path is the same as last one
(if the path is simple , then cyclic is a simple cyclic)

                  A
                  ↑↓ 
                  B

A cycle in a undirected graph is a path of at least 3 length such that the first vertax on the path is the same as last one
                 A __ B
                 \   /
                   C
