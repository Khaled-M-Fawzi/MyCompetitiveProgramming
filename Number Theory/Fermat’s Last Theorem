According to Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem, no three positive integers a, b, c satisfy the equation
a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer value of n greater than 2
For n = 1 and n = 2, the equation have infinitely many solutions

Some solutions for n = 1 are,
 2 + 3 = 5
 7 + 13 = 20
 5 + 6 = 11
 10 + 9 = 19

Some solutions for n = 2 are,
5^2 + 12^2 = 13^2     
3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2    
8^2 + 15^2 = 17^2    
9^2 + 40^2 = 41^2
