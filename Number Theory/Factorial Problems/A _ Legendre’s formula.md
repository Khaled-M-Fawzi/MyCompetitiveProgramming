### what is max x such that m^x divides n!?

Again, think in prime representation.

Assume g = n!

let's simplify, such that m^x divides g?

Let m =  2^3 * 5^4

Let g =  2^10 * 5^8 * 11^3

the prime factor of m that are 2 and 5

10/3 = 3, then max for p1=2 is (2^3)^3 = 2^9

8/4 = 2, so max is (5^4)^2 = 5^8

Then let x = min(3, 2) = 2 ... so m^2 divides g

what if m = 2^3 * 5^4 * 7^2 ? then it doesn't divide g, and x = 0
