proper divisors of number :: is all divisors of number excluding the number itself
For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2, 3 and 6 but it's proper divisors is 1, 2, 3

perfect number :: is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors
For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number
