# Adhoc & Greedy & Implementation

**Adhoc** :: means that problem does not require any prerequisite knowledge of any algorithm or data structure or high level mathematical
concept and can be solved using basic logical skills or sometimes even by common sense.

**Greedy** :: is an algorithmic strategy that makes the best optimal choice at each small stage with the goal of this eventually 
leading to a globally optimum solution

**Implementation** :: means that problem is a bit tricky to implement.
