Set : is a well-defined collection of distinct objects 

For example, the numbers 2, 4, and 6 are distinct objects when considered separately, but when they are considered collectively they 
form a single set of size three, written {2, 4, 6} 

(No order)
the order in a set is not important , Thus {2,6,4} , {4,6,2} , {6,2,4} , {4,2,6} ,{6,4,2} are all representations of set {2,4,6}

(No repeation)
repeated elements of the set can be ignored
{ 3,5,6,5,5,3} ===>>> {3,5,6}
{1,1,7,2,7,2,2,2}  ===>>> {1,2,7}


Another way to define a set 
x={x | x is a positive integer less than 10}
x={1,2,3,...,9}

x={x | x is a letter in car}
x={'c','a','r'}


Î¦ = {} is empty set  // phi
