if n is even then n^2 is even

if n is odd then n^2 is odd

Any integer , it's double is even

2 ==>> 4 (even)

3 ==>> 6 (even)


even ==>> 2k      where k is even number

odd  ==>> 2k+1    where k is even number

We can find the number of palindrome numbers with fixed length k â€” it is about **10^floor((1+k)/2)**


to find the number of palindromic numbers no larger than n  **sqrt(n)**
