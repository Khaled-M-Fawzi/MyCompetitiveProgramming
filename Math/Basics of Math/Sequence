Sequence : is a collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed and order is important
The number of elements (possibly infinite) of the sequenc is called the length of the sequence

Difference between set and sequence ?
set ==>> no order , no repetition
sequence ==>> order and repetition are important

sequenc 1,2,3 is not the same as sequenc 1,3,2
sequenc 1,2,2 is not the same as sequenc 1,1,2

set corresponding to sequenc 2,2,7,1,7,1,1 is {1,2,7}

Formula of Sequence 
1) Explicit functions 
depends on the index n of the element
S(n) = 2 + n       0<= n <=10
s(0) = 2 + 0 = 2   first element
s(1) = 2 + 1 = 3   second element
s(2) = 2 + 2 = 4   third element

2) Recursive functions
depends on the previous element
5! = 5 * 4!
4! = 4 * 3!
3! = 3 * 2!
2! = 2 * 1!
1! = 1
F(1) = 1 , F(n) = n * F(n-1)

Ex S = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,...
S(1) = 1 , S(2) = 1 , S(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-2)

String sequence : a,b,c,3,5,'',""
.letters , numbers and special letters
.no commas
.if we remove commas from a sequence it becomes string
