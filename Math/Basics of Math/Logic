Logic	
The value of a logical expression is either true (1) or false (0). The most important logical operators are 	
¬ (negation)	
∧ (conjunction)	
∨ (disjunction)	
⊕ (exclusive)	
⇒(implication)	
⇔ (equivalence)	

A   B   ¬A   ¬B   A∧B   A∨B   A⊕B   A⇒B   A⇔B	
0   0    1    1    0     0     0      1      1	
0   1    1    0    0     1     1      1      0	
1   0    0    1    0     1     1      0      0	
1   1    0    0    1     1     0      1      1	

A⇒B          equals    (¬A)∨B        ||     A⇔B         equals     ¬(A⊕B)	
A∨B          equals     B∨A           ||     A∧B          equals      B∧A	
A∨(B∨C)      equals    (A∨B)∨C        ||     A∧(B∧C)      equals     (A∧B)∧C         // Associative	
A∨(B∧C)      equals    (A∨B)∧(A∨C)    ||     A∧(B∨C)      equals     (A∧B)∨(A∧C)    // Commutative	
¬(A∨B)       equals    (¬A)∧(¬B)      ||     ¬(A∧B)       equals    (¬A)∨(¬B)        	
A∨A          equals       A           ||      A∧A         equals        A	
A⇒B         equals    (¬A)⇒(¬B)      ||      A⇔B        equals        (A⇒B)∨(B⇒A)	
¬(A⇒B)      equals       A∧(¬B)	
¬(¬A)        equals       A 	


A predicate is an expression that is true or false depending on its parameters . Predicates are usually denoted by capital letters 	
For example, we can define a predicate P(x) that is true exactly when x is a prime number 	
Using this definition, P(7) is true but P(8) is false	

A quantifier connects a logical expression to the elements of a set. The most important quantifiers are ∀ (for all) and ∃ (there is)	
For example, ∀x(∃y(y < x))	
means that for each element x in the set, there is an element y in the set such that y is smaller than x 	
This is true in the set of integers, but false in the set of natural numbers	
Using the notation described above, we can express many kinds of logical propositions	
For example  ∀x((x > 1 ∧ ¬P(x)) ⇒ (∃a(∃b(x = ab ∧ a > 1 ∧ b > 1))))	
means that if a number x is larger than 1 and not a prime number, then there are	
numbers a and b that are larger than 1 and whose product is x. This proposition is true in the set of integers
