# Probability Theory

**Probability** refers to the extent of occurrence of events. When an event occurs like throwing a ball, picking a card from deck, etc ., then the must be some probability associated with that event.

In terms of mathematics, probability refers to the ratio of wanted outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes (wanted outcomes/total outcomes). 

There are three approaches to the theory of probability, namely:

- Empirical Approach
- Classical Approach
- Axiomatic Approach

In this article, we are going to study about Axiomatic Approach.In this approach, we represent the probability in terms of sample space(S) and other terms.
