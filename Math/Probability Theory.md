# Probability Theory

**Probability** refers to the extent of occurrence of events. When an event occurs like throwing a ball, picking a card from deck, etc ., then the must be some probability associated with that event.

In terms of mathematics, probability refers to the ratio of wanted outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes (wanted outcomes/total outcomes). 

There are three approaches to the theory of probability, namely:

- Empirical Approach
- Classical Approach
- Axiomatic Approach

In this article, we are going to study about Axiomatic Approach.In this approach, we represent the probability in terms of sample space(S) and other terms.

**Probability of an Event** – If there are total p possible outcomes associated with a random experiment and q of them are favourable outcomes to the event A, then the probability of event A is denoted by P(A) and is given by P(A) = q/p 

The probability of non occurrence of event A, i.e, P(A’) = 1 – P(A)

**Note**

- If the value of P(A) = 1, then event A is called sure event .
- If the value of P(A) = 0, then event A is called impossible event.
- Also, P(A) + P(A’) = 1

**Theorems**

General – Let A, B, C are the events associated with a random experiment, then

- P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A∩B)
- P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) if A and B are mutually exclusive
- P(A∪B∪C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) – P(A∩B) – P(B∩C)- P(C∩A) + P(A∩B∩C)
- P(A∩B’) = P(A) – P(A∩B)
- P(A’∩B) = P(B) – P(A∩B)

Extension of Multiplication Theorem – Let A1, A2, ….., An are n events associated with a random experiment, then

P(A1∩A2∩A3 ….. An) = P(A1)P(A2/A1)P(A3/A2∩A1) ….. P(An/A1∩A2∩A3∩ ….. ∩An-1)
