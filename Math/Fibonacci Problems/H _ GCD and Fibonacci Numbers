You are given two positive numbers M and N
The task is to print greatest common divisor of M’th and N’th Fibonacci Numbers.

The first few Fibonacci Numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ….
Note that 0 is considered as 0’th Fibonacci Number.

Input  : M = 3, N = 6
Output :  2
Fib(3) = 2, Fib(6) = 8
GCD of above two numbers is 2

Input  : M = 8, N = 12
Output :  3
Fib(8) = 21, Fib(12) = 144
GCD of above two numbers is 3

A Simple Solution is to follow below steps
1) Find M’th Fibonacci Number.
2) Find N’th Fibonacci Number.
3) Return GCD of two numbers.

A Better Solution is based on below identity

GCD(Fib(M), Fib(N)) = Fib(GCD(M, N))

The above property holds because Fibonacci Numbers follow
Divisibility Sequence, i.e., if M divides N, then Fib(M)
also divides N. For example, Fib(3) = 2 and every third
third Fibonacci Number is even.

The steps are:
1) Find GCD of M and N. Let GCD be g.
2) Return Fib(g).
