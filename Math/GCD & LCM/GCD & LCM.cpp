// GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) or HCF (Highest Common Factor)
/*
GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them . A simple way to find GCD is to factorize both numbers 
and multiply common factors
36 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3
60 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5

gcd = Multiplication of common factors
    = 2 * 2 * 3
    = 12

we express the 2 numbers in form of : m = qn + r 
find gcd of 190 , 34
190 = 5 (34) + 20
34 = 1 (20) + 14
20 = 1 (14) + 6
14 = 2 (6) + 2
6 = 3 (2) + 0
2 is GCD of 190 , 34
we have another way to find gcd of 2 numbers called successive difference

gcd is 2 because a == b

Below is a recursive function to evaluate gcd using Euclideanâ€™s algorithm
