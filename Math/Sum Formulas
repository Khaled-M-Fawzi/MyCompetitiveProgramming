sum(x=1,n) x   = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n*(n+1)/2
sum(x=1,n) x^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + ... + n*n = n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6

Arithmetic Progression (AP):: is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive numbers is constant
n ==>> number of elements , a ==>> first element , b ==>> last element , r ==>> difference between any two consecutive numbers
a + (r+a) + (2r+a) + (3r+a) + ... + b
3 , 7 , 11 , 15 , 19 , 23 , 27
i'th term = a + (n-1) * r
