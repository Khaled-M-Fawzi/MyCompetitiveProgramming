# Congruence Equations

'a ≡ b (mod n)'

called a and b congruent modulo n, It means a%n = b%n = x, this means (a-b) % n = 0

57 ≡ 37 (mod 10) AND 57 - 37 = 20

57%10 = 37% 10 = 7, Also 20 % 10 = 0

More importantly: a = b+qn for some q integer (a-b = qn)

If ax ≡ ay (mod n) and gcd(a,n) = d, then the congruence is equivalent x ≡ y (mod n/d)

IF ax ≡ ay (mod n) SAME as x ≡ y (mod n) THEN d = 1, Reverse doesn’t need this condition.

### Congruence Facts

- IF a ≡ b (mod m)  a^n ≡ b^n (mod m) for all  n>= 1

- If p is prime , (x+y)^p ≡ x^p + y^p (mod p)

- If a ≡ b (mod m) and b ≡ c (mod m), then a ≡ c (mod m)

- If a ≡ b (mod m) and c ≡ d (mod m), then a + c ≡ b + d (mod m)
