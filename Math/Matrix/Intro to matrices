A matrix is a rectangular arrangement of numbers into rows and columns
For example, matrix A has two rows and three columns

             3 Columns
             
           | -2  5  6 |
      A =  |          | 2 Rows
           |  5  2  7 |
           
           
Matrix dimensions
The dimensions of a matrix tells its size : the number of rows and columns of the matrix, in that order
Since matrix A has two rows and three columns , we write its dimensions as 2 x 3 , pronounced "two by three"
When working with matrix dimensions, remember row x columns

Matrix elements
A matrix element is simply a matrix entry
Each element in a matrix is identified by naming the row and column in which it appears

the element g(2,1) is the entry in the second row and the first column

        |4  14 -7|
    G = |18  5 13|
        |-20 4 22|
  in this case , g(2,1) = 18
  
in general , the element in row i and column j of matrix A is denoted as a(i,j)
